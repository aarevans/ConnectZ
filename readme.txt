ConnectZ Challenge
******************
Two files included - ConnectZ.py and GameBoard.py 
ConnectZ file references the Board class on the GameBoard file. 
Challenge completed in this way in other to help with testing as a seperate file (not included) was created
to test methods developed within the class before they were then added into the main script. Decoupling in this
way allows better, more efficient development.
